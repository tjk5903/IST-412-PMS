# **About The Project**
___
>This project is about creating a functional Patient Management System (PMS). There are many stakeholders to think of in this situation as well as a large amount of rules and regulations to follow such as HIPAA.

The nurses and doctors should be able to see the medical history, but the nurse will not be able to edit it they will be able to leave detailed notes for the doctor to look over.
